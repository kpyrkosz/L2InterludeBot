tl;dr
That's a bot playing lineage 2 interlude version I wrote during the first months of pandemic. I've never thought of monetizing or profiting from the bot itself,
that's why the program since beginning was tailored to my needs and may contain nonintuitive features but I dont really care.
I've been using it to run a 6 PC botfarm on L2Mordor server for +- 8 months, without gettin caught. I'm a lazy person, that's why I bot :)
It grew over time and became quite usable, I'm releasing the source because I stopped playing the game, and also to let curious people learn how do these things work.

The build process and usage are not that complex but I just dont have power to explain it all at the moment. I'm only releasing the source.

feature list:
* targeting monsters inside specified bounding box
* prioritizing monsters that attack you or party member
* melee attack
* assist attack (optionally waiting for the target to start attacking)
* spoil/sweep
* follow
* casting spells on monsters
* buffing party members
* self buffs
* using items under condition (HP/MANA/always)
* auto accepting party from specified user
* seeding and sowing
* feeding beastfarm beasts
* picking items
* blacklisting monsters to target, attack or sweep
* alarm on boss spawn
* crafting materials, soulshots, weapons with the ability to create higher level materials from lower ones
* the controller (HUB) may be run on other PC than the bots - the bots connect and talk over TCP
and many many more
